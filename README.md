ENGR100-950 - Electronics for Atmospheric & Space Measurements

## Website

Website is built on [primer-spec](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec) built by the UM EECS 485 staff. The website hosts the syllabus, class information, resources, tutorials, and the spec for all the labs.

Visit the webpage [here](https://950.engr100.org)

## Arduino

This class uses a library published through the Arduino IDE to hold the starter code for each lab. View the library reference for ENGR100-950 [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/engr100-950/).

View the library status from Arduino [here](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/logs/github.com/engin100/950/). This is useful for monitoring builds and deployments of new versions.

## Power Boards

The KiCAD files for the power management PCBs we print and launch on high altitude weather balloons are located [here](https://github.com/engin100/power-boards)

## Solder Challenge

We use [this](https://github.com/engin100/solder-challenge) project for our PCBs to print and the BOM linked in that repo for parts to order to run student solder challenges.
