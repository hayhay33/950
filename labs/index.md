# Labs

As we publish labs, they will become available here.

## Lab 1: Arduino 101

Learning how to program and wire an Arduino micro-controller to control LEDs on a breadboard.

### Lab 1b: Creating an Altium Schematic

Learning how to produce a PCB schematic in Altium.

[Link to lab 1b](/labs/lab-1b)

## Lab 2: Temperature Sensing

Using our Arduino and circuitry knowledge to read data from a temperature sensor and plot it in real-time.

## Lab 3: Creating a Standalone Circuit and Adding Sensors

Saving Arduino sensor data to a microSD card so that we can use it later, and powering an Arduino with a battery. Additionally, adding more sensors such as pressure, acceleration, and humidity sensors.

:warning: This *may* come in handy when launching our weather balloons...
